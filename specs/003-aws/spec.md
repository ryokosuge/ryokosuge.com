# Feature Specification: AWS Deployment Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `003-aws`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AWSで公開できるような構成を決めたい"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: AWS月額予算の上限はどのくらいを想定していますか？ → A: 最小限（月額$1-5程度）- 個人ブログ、コスト優先
- Q: 想定される月間訪問者数（トラフィック規模）はどのくらいですか？ → A: 小規模（月間1,000-10,000訪問）- 個人ブログ、ニッチなトピック
- Q: カスタムドメイン名は既にお持ちですか？ → A: 既に所有している（ryokosuge.comなど）
- Q: デプロイの自動化レベルはどこまで必要ですか？ → A: 完全自動 - GitHubへのpush時に自動デプロイ（CI/CD）
- Q: 監視・アラート機能はどの程度必要ですか？ → A: 基本的な監視 - サイトダウン時のみ通知

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identify need: AWS deployment architecture for Hugo static site
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Site visitors, content authors, deployment system
   → Actions: Host static site, serve content, deploy updates
   → Data: Static HTML/CSS/JS files generated by Hugo
   → Constraints: Cost-effective, reliable, scalable
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → RESOLVED: Expected traffic volume/scale = 1,000-10,000 monthly visits
   → RESOLVED: Budget constraints = $1-5/month
   → RESOLVED: Custom domain = ryokosuge.com (already owned)
   → RESOLVED: Deployment automation = Full CI/CD via GitHub
   → RESOLVED: CDN requirements = Not critical (low traffic, cost priority)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow: Deploy Hugo site → Visitors access content
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → SUCCESS: All critical clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a blog owner, I want to deploy my Hugo-generated static site to AWS so that visitors can reliably access my content from anywhere in the world with fast load times and minimal operational overhead, while keeping costs under $5/month.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Hugo site content is ready for deployment, **When** content is pushed to GitHub main branch, **Then** updated content becomes available to visitors automatically within 5 minutes
2. **Given** a visitor accesses ryokosuge.com, **When** they request any page, **Then** content is served over HTTPS with page load time under 3 seconds
3. **Given** site content is updated, **When** new deployment occurs, **Then** visitors see the updated content without any downtime
4. **Given** multiple visitors access the site simultaneously (up to 10,000 monthly visits), **When** traffic occurs, **Then** site remains responsive and available
5. **Given** site becomes unavailable, **When** downtime exceeds 1 minute, **Then** site owner receives alert notification

### Edge Cases
- What happens when deployment fails mid-process? → Previous version remains live, owner receives notification
- How does the system handle traffic spikes beyond expected 10,000 monthly visits? → System continues to serve content but may incur additional costs
- What happens if a visitor accesses the site during deployment? → No impact, zero-downtime deployment required
- How are broken links or missing assets handled? → Standard HTTP 404 errors returned to visitor
- What happens when SSL certificate renewal is needed? → System automatically renews certificate without manual intervention

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST serve all static site files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) to visitors
- **FR-002**: System MUST support HTTPS connections for secure access
- **FR-003**: System MUST be accessible via custom domain ryokosuge.com
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically deploy updated site content when pushed to GitHub main branch
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain site availability during content updates (zero-downtime deployment)
- **FR-006**: System MUST serve content with page load time under 3 seconds for typical pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST scale to handle up to 10,000 monthly visits without degradation
- **FR-008**: System MUST operate within monthly budget of $1-5 USD
- **FR-009**: System MUST send alerts to site owner when site is down for more than 1 minute
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically renew SSL certificates without manual intervention
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide basic uptime monitoring
- **FR-012**: System SHOULD retain deployment history for troubleshooting (nice-to-have within budget constraints)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Cost optimization is the primary constraint - all design decisions must prioritize staying within $1-5/month budget
- **NFR-002**: Deployment automation via GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD is required
- **NFR-003**: Monitoring limited to basic uptime checks (downtime alerts only)
- **NFR-004**: Performance target: 3-second page load for typical blog pages under normal traffic
- **NFR-005**: Availability target: 99% uptime (acceptable for personal blog)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Static Site Content**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and asset files generated by Hugo build process
- **Deployment Package**: Bundle of static files ready for hosting, triggered by GitHub push
- **Site Configuration**: Domain settings (ryokosuge.com), SSL certificates, routing rules
- **Deployment History**: Record of when and what content was deployed (if within budget)
- **Alert Configuration**: Uptime monitoring settings and notification preferences
