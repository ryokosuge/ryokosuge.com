## Conversation

**Coach**: So, what do you like to do in your free time? Do you have any hobbies that you're really passionate about?

**Student**: I like to study English in free time. I enjoy study English. and I don't have hobbies. but I have a daughter. I always play with a daughter.

**Coach**: That's really sweet! Playing with your daughter sounds like such a wonderful way to spend your time. How old is she? And studying English in your free time - that's quite impressive! It shows real dedication. What do you enjoy most about learning English? Is it the grammar, vocabulary, or maybe being able to communicate with people from different countries? Do you and your daughter have any favorite games or activities you like to do together?

**Student**: My daughter is three years old. She is four years old in next month. Abount English Studying. I engjoy play Duolingo! it play everyday.

**Coach**: Oh, that's such a fun age! Three years old - they're so curious and full of energy at that stage. And turning four next month, that's exciting! Duolingo is great! I love how it makes learning feel like a game. Do you have a streak going? And what language are you learning on there - just English, or are you studying other languages too? With your daughter being that age, I bet she's starting to talk a lot more now. Does she ever try to join in when you're doing your English practice, or does she have her own little language learning going on?

**Student**: I learning on English! I don't study other languages. English is difficault for me. My daughter can speak English a little. She goes to English class every weekend.

**Coach**: That's amazing that your daughter is already learning English too! Going to English class every weekend at her age - she's getting such a great head start. What does she like most about her English classes? Does she come home and try to teach you what she learned? And I totally understand English being difficult - it's a tricky language with all those irregular verbs and pronunciation rules! But you're doing great by practicing every day with Duolingo. That consistency really helps. Do you ever practice English together with your daughter? Like, maybe singing English songs or reading simple English books together?

**Student**: Sound's good. I prefer reading simple English books!

**Coach**: That's a great choice! Reading simple English books together is such a wonderful way to bond and learn at the same time. What kind of books do you and your daughter enjoy? Are they picture books, or maybe some beginner-level storybooks? Reading together must be really helpful for both of you - you get to practice your English, and she gets to hear proper pronunciation and learn new words. Do you have any favorite books that you've read together so far? It sounds like you're creating such a nice learning environment for both of you. That's really special!

## Polished Script

**"My Free Time and Family Life"**

"In my free time, I really enjoy studying English. I'm actually quite passionate about it and use Duolingo every day to practice. It's become a fun daily habit for me, even though English can be quite challenging at times.

I don't really have traditional hobbies, but I spend most of my free time playing with my three-year-old daughter. She's turning four next month, and she's just full of energy and curiosity. We have such a great time together!

Interestingly, my daughter is also learning English - she goes to English classes every weekend. She can already speak a little English, and it's amazing to see how quickly she picks things up at her age. Sometimes she even tries to teach me what she learned in class!

One of our favorite activities together is reading simple English books. I think it's perfect because I get to practice my English while she learns new words and hears proper pronunciation. It's become a special bonding time for us, and I love seeing her excitement when we discover new stories together.

I'm really committed to improving my English, partly because I want to be able to communicate better with people from different countries, but also because I want to support my daughter's language learning journey. It's wonderful that we can learn and grow together!"
